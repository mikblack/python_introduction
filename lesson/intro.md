# Introduction to Python and programming.

Python is primarily a programming language, not a statistical package with some programming
tacked on. Like R.

It is old, concieved in the late 1980s and implemented in 1989, thats 26 years ago. 

Currently still has 2 major version python2 and python3. The transition has been slow. 
This is because some changes to the code would have meant important 3rd party libriaries would have needed a rewrite,

It has some core pholosophies.

- Beautful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complext
- Complex is better than comppilacted
- Readability counts


Python is a programming language that I think is useful, however, it presents
an oppourtunity to teach some core programming concepts.

In this lesson I will cover briefly, with exercises, 3 core programming concepts.

- variables
- loops
- data structures
- functions 

And finally showing will work through some boiler plate code for creating Python command-line programs
