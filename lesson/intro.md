# Introduction to Python and programming.

Python is primarily a programming language, not a statistical package with some programming
tacked on. Like R.

It is old, concieved in the late 1980s and implemented in 1989, thats 26 years ago. 

It has some core pholosophies.

    - Beautful is better than ugly
    - Explicit is better than implicit
    - Simple is better than complext
    - Complex is better than comppilacted
    - Readability counts
